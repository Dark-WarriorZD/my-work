Esther Hautzig's emotions underwent a profound transformation from the moment she took home the "filthy rag of a skirt" to her heartfelt expression of gratitude to God for the gift. The author employs vivid descriptions and powerful language techniques to portray Esther's evolving feelings, revealing her resilience and gratitude amidst difficult circumstances.

Upon receiving the ragged skirt, Esther's initial reaction is one of disappointment and resentment. The author captures her disillusionment through the embedded quote, "I took home the filthy rag of a skirt." This choice of words, utilizing a metaphor, conveys Esther's perception of the skirt as something worthless and degrading. The metaphor emphasizes the poor condition of the garment, symbolizing her low expectations and the lack of material possessions in her life.

However, a profound shift occurs within Esther as she reflects on her situation. The author reveals this transformation through the embedded quote, "and thanked God for the gift." Here, the author uses a juxtaposition of contrasting ideas to highlight Esther's newfound gratitude. This shift in perspective showcases her ability to find gratitude in the midst of hardship, demonstrating her resilience and strength of character.

Additionally, the author employs repetition as a language technique to emphasize Esther's determination and resourcefulness. The phrase "one more cup of flour, one more sip of milk" is repeated, creating a rhythmic pattern that underscores Esther's tenacity. The repetition not only serves to emphasize her relentless pursuit of sustenance but also symbolizes her unwavering hope and her ability to find solace in the simplest of things.

Moreover, the author utilizes imagery to evoke a sense of poverty and scarcity. The description of the skirt as a "filthy rag" conjures vivid mental images of its tattered and unclean state. This visual imagery serves as a stark reminder of the difficult circumstances in which Esther finds herself, adding depth to her emotional journey and highlighting her ability to find gratitude amidst adversity.

In conclusion, Esther Hautzig's emotional journey, from disappointment to gratitude, is effectively portrayed through the author's skilled use of language techniques. The metaphor and juxtaposition highlight Esther's evolving perceptions and emotions, while the repetition emphasizes her determination and resilience. The vivid imagery employed by the author further immerses the reader in Esther's world, allowing them to empathize with her ability to find gratitude and hope even in the face of challenging circumstances. done
